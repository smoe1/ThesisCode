// The purpose of this module is to implement various 1D quadrature rules that are
// required throughout DoGPack.  In most cases, building a multi-dimensional
// quadrature rule requires performing a tensor product of 1D quadrature
// weights and points.  This module describes the 1D rules that can be used to
// define higher dimensional quadrature rules.
//
// Two versions of each rule have been implemented.  If one is interested in
// performing numerical integration, then the version that uses points and
// weights should be called.  On the other hand, if one is only interested in
// constructing *points*, for example with applying a positivity-preserving
// limiter, then one should use the version that only sets the quadrature
// points.
