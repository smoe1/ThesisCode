1. Implement dTensor6 tensors.  The Cartesian grid requires a total of 6 indices
to be implemented in a similar fashion to previous tensors:

    ( 1:mx, 1:my, 1:mz, 1:mw, 1:meqn, 1:kmax )

2. Implement the "slice" functions. These include the ReadSlice and WriteSlice
functions, as defined in the current "hybrid" code.

3. Define advection speeds (this will require a bit of thought - remember to
keep in mind we may want to use multiple species!)

4. Pull the StepSL_Quiet routine from the hybrid code, and put in a
semi-Lagrangian or the main library.

5. Perform the following steps to get a working 4D code:

a) Get a code that compiles (CHECK!)
b) Print the initial conditions, and check for convergence.
c) Think about using Vizit or HDF5?
d) Perform advecition in quadruple periodic boundary conditions, with constant
coefficent advection.
